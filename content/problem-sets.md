## Problem Set 1

### Exercise 1

### Exercise 2

- To improve a sum of prospects means to substitute one prospect by a more preferred one. In the sum of $y_i$ substitute  $y_i$ by $x_i$ where $x_i \succcurlyeq y_i$.
    
### Exercise 3

To show: Transitivity, additivity and monotonicity preclude a Dutch book.

Dutch book:

$$x_1 \succcurlyeq y_1$$
$$\cdots$$
$$x_n \succcurlyeq y_n$$

$$But \sum x(s) \geq \sum y(s) \forall s$$

Suppose $x_i \succcurlyeq y_i \forall i$.

If Dutch book exists, $\sum x_i(s) \leq  \sum y_i(s) \forall s$
